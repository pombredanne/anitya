Anitya Development Guide
========================

Anitya welcomes contributions! Our issue tracker is located on
`GitHub <https://github.com/fedora-infra/anitya/issues>`_.


Contribution Guidelines
-----------------------

When you make a pull request, a Fedora Infrastructure team member will review your
code. Please make sure you follow the guidelines below:

Code style
^^^^^^^^^^

We follow the `PEP8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ style guide for Python.
The test suite includes a test that enforces the required style, so all you need to do is
run the tests to ensure your code follows the style. If the unit test passes, you are
good to go!

Unit tests
^^^^^^^^^^
The test suites can be run using `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_ by simply running
``tox`` from the repository root. These tests include unit tests, a linter to ensure
Python code style is correct, and checks the documentation for Sphinx warnings or
errors.

All tests must pass. All new code should have 100% test coverage.
Any bugfix should be accompanied by one or more unit tests to demonstrate the fix.
If you are unsure how to write unit tests for your code, we will be happy to help
you during the code review process.

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Anitya uses `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ to create its documentation.
New packages, modules, classes, methods, functions, and attributes all should be
documented using `"Google style" <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/latest/ext/example_google.html>`_
docstrings. For historical reasons you may encounter plain reStructuredText-style
docstrings. Please consider converting them and opening a pull request!

Python API documentation is automatically generated from the code using Sphinx's
`autodoc <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/tutorial.html#autodoc>`_ extension.
HTTP REST API documentation is automatically generated from the code using the
`httpdomain <http://pythonhosted.org/sphinxcontrib-httpdomain/>`_ extension.


Development Environment
-----------------------

The development environment is set up using `Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>`_. You can use
this to set up a development enviroment on any host, but only the Ansible playbook on hosts you
are willing to reprovision since it expects to own the host. It does things like write to
``~/.bashrc`` and ``/etc/motd``.

Vagrant
^^^^^^^

The best way to set up a development enviroment is to use `Vagrant <https://vagrantup.com/>`_.
Vagrant provisions a new virtual machine and then runs the Ansible playbook on it automatically.
To get started, install Vagrant::

    $ sudo dnf install vagrant libvirt vagrant-libvirt vagrant-sshfs ansible

Next, clone the repository and configure your Vagrantfile::

    $ git clone https://github.com/fedora-infra/anitya.git
    $ cd anitya
    $ cp Vagrantfile.example Vagrantfile
    $ vagrant up
    $ vagrant reload
    $ vagrant ssh

You now have a functional development environment. The message of the day for the virtual machine
has some helpful tips, but the anitya service can be started in the virtual machine with::

    $ systemctl --user start anitya.service

Log output is viewable with ``journalctl`` and you can navigate to http://localhost:5000/ to
view the web user interface.
